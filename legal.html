      <h4 class="legal-simple">Use of Cookies</h4>
      <p>What are cookies and why are cookies used:</p>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that contain a unique string of characters.
        They are stored in your web browser's memory when you visit a website.
        When you return to a website that has placed a cookie in your browser,
        it allows the website to recognize your previous visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        While cookies are commonly used for measuring website usage, such as the
        number of visitors and duration of visit, and for enhancing ease of
        navigation, they can also personalize the experience for known visitors
        by associating cookies with profile information or user preferences.
        This information provides valuable insights to improve the user
        experience over time.
      </p>
      <h4 class="legal-simple">How we use Cookies:</h4>
      <p>
        We use cookies and related technologies ("Cookies") to provide Services,
        gather information during user navigation, enhance and personalize the
        user experience, understand usage patterns, and improve our Sites,
        products, and Services.
      </p>
      <p>The Cookies used on our Sites fall into the following categories:</p>
      <p>
        Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential for the website
        to function properly. They are usually set in response to your actions,
        such as privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. Blocking
        or disabling these cookies may impact the functionality of certain parts
        of the site. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable
        information. Functional and Performance Cookies: These cookies enhance
        website functionality and personalization. They help us count visits and
        traffic sources, measure and improve site performance, and analyze
        popular and unpopular pages. The information collected by these cookies
        is aggregated and anonymous. Some of these cookies may be set by us or
        by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages, such
        as Google Analytics. Blocking or disabling these cookies may affect the
        performance monitoring of our website. Marketing and Advertising
        (Targeting) Cookies: These cookies may be set by our advertising
        partners. They create a profile of your interests and display relevant
        advertisements on other websites. These cookies do not directly store
        personal information but rely on browser and internet device
        identification. If you block or disable these cookies, you may
        experience less targeted advertising.
      </p>
      <h4 class="legal-simple">Pixel Tags:</h4>
      <p>
        Pixel tags, also known as clear gifs, web beacons, or single-pixel gifs,
        are small electronic files embedded in web pages or emails. They enable
        us to track page visits, email opens, and other related website
        statistics, such as content popularity and system integrity. Pixel tags
        serve a similar purpose as cookies but are embedded directly in web
        pages or emails. We may utilize pixel tags in our email marketing
        activities to track email open rates and assess the effectiveness of our
        campaigns.
      </p>

      <h4 class="legal-simple">How to Control Cookies:</h4>
      <p>
        You can manage your Cookie settings by reviewing your internet browser
        settings, typically found under "Help" or "Internet Options." Depending
        on your preferences, you can choose to block all cookies, block only
        third-party cookies, or allow first-party cookies. Please note that
        blocking all cookies may restrict access to our Sites and impact the
        intended functionality. To make full use of our features and Services,
        we recommend enabling at least first-party cookies. Device- and
        browser-specific opt-outs, such as the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser
        Add-on, are available to exercise choice regarding specific Cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Sites provide Cookie Management Tools to customize Cookie activity
        easily. Please use these tools to manage your cookie settings.
